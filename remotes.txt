# This is a sample remotes file.
# It will probably be kept accutate for the hardfought network
# but you should define your own, and set REMOTES in the config
# to point to it.
# Format is: tag ssh_path_to_chroot
# ssh path is user@fqdn:/chroot/path
# the ssh user needs to trust our ssh pubkey, and have read
# access to all the bones files.
# set MYTAG to match the tag corresponding to the local server
# (rather than maintaining different remotes for each server)
# Comments start with a '#' and will be ignored.
